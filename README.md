# AI-Powered Insurance Claim Decision System

**Tech Stack:**  
Express.js ¬∑ Node.js ¬∑ LangChain ¬∑ Google Generative AI API ¬∑ Pinecone

Developed at **Bajaj HackRx 6.0**, this Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) backend automates **insurance claim decisions** and answers policy-related queries with high accuracy.  
The system uses **Google Gemini** for query rewriting & decision-making, **GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings** for vector creation, and **Pinecone** for semantic clause retrieval.
